        'Oral Cancer – How to be Aware', 'April is Oral Health Awareness month in Canada, and when most people think about oral health, the first aspects coming into mind are cavities and gum disease. That makes sense, as cavities and gum disease are the main causes of most dental problems, as both are extremely common. But did you know there’s a type of condition that, although rare, is something that must be urgently treated?',
        require("../assets/blog/oral-cancer.webp"),
        `This condition is oral cancer, which is cancer around the mouth, including on the lips, tongue, or inside the jawbones. <br /> <div>&nbsp;</div> <img src=${require("../assets/blog/giphy.gif")} /> <br /> <div>&nbsp;</div> What are the signs of oral cancer? <br /><div>&nbsp;</div> The most common sign of oral cancer is a wound in our mouth or on our lip that does not heal. <br /><div>&nbsp;</div> If you’ve ever had a canker sore, it manifests itself similar to that. <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/canker-sore/symptoms-causes/syc-20370615" >Canker sores</a> usually take around 2 weeks to heal, but in the case of cancer, these wounds will not heal with time, especially when there’s no obvious reason for the wound occurring (such as constant trauma in that same area). <br /><div>&nbsp;</div> These suspicious lesions can grow in size and change colour, and most of the time there’s no pain associated with them, so it is easy to overlook and miss. <br /> <div>&nbsp;</div> When oral cancer is in the jawbone, it is often invisible to the eye, but on dental x-rays they can be visualized by a dental professional. <br /> <div>&nbsp;</div> In addition, teeth that suddenly feel “loose” without a history of gum disease, or rapid changes in speech and swallowing may also indicate a problem <br /> <div>&nbsp;</div> What are the risk factors for oral cancer? <br /><div>&nbsp;</div> Risk factors for oral cancer including tobacco usage, drinking alcohol, human papilloma virus (HPV), and UV light. Some people are also at higher risk due to genetic factors that could compromise their immune system.<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div> <img src=${require("../assets/blog/giphy-1.gif")} />  <br /> <div>&nbsp;</div> What can I do? <br /> <div>&nbsp;</div> One way to screen yourself for oral cancer is to look at our mouths with a mirror in a brightly lit room. Stick your tongue out, look at all sides of the tongue, and compare the left and right halves of the tongue to see if there’s any differences. Also look at the soft pad of tissue below your tongue (also known as the floor of the mouth) and see if there’s any difference between the left and right sides. <br /> <div>&nbsp;</div> Please watch out for any wound on the lips that isn’t healing as well. <br /> <div>&nbsp;</div> If anything is noted, they should be promptly looked at by a dental or medical professional. <br /> <div>&nbsp;</div> To lower the risk of oral cancer, it is best to lower or eliminate the use of tobacco products and alcohol intake in our lives. This not only helps with reducing the risk of oral cancer, but also benefits our overall health in the long run. <br /><div>&nbsp;</div> The high risk strains of human papilloma virus are HPV-16 and HPV-18.Thankfull there is a vaccine available for many strains of HPV, <a href="http://immunizebc.ca/hpv" > and in BC some people are eligible for free vaccination.</a> <br /> <div>&nbsp;</div> Cancers on the lip are most commonly caused by excessive exposure to the sun without protection. So to prevent that, using SPF-certified lip balms would go a long way to help protect our lips when we go out on sunny days.<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div> <div>&nbsp;</div> <img src= ${require("../assets/blog/118b5d_0ba754e548d5485b98dad88dd6bd5212_mv2.webp")} /> <br /><div>&nbsp;</div>   <br /> Here at <a href="http://www.mc2dental.ca/">MC<sup>2</sup> Dental,</a> our team gives all patients a thorough oral cancer screening during exams.

Adding baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) has two benefits for our oral health. The first benefit is that baking soda can help remove coffee and tea stains from our teeth. The second benefit is that it raises the pH of our saliva, which helps negates any acid from eating away our teeth.<br /><div>&nbsp;</div>As a bonus, some toothpastes contain both baking soda and fluoride in them.

        require("../assets/blog/118b5d_b1bdbc7be909416e9cb1c088a8edde35_mv2.webp"),
        `In dentistry, there are some common misconceptions and myths that deter people from regular visits to their dental professional. Here’s a list of a few commonly heard by us and our colleagues.<br /><div>&nbsp;</div>1) X-rays are harmful to me, and dentists take them unnecessarily with no benefit.<br /><div>&nbsp;</div>As mentioned in <a>  a previous blog post,</a>the benefits of appropriately prescribed dental x-rays are critical to provide comprehensive dental care.<br /><div>&nbsp;</div>In modern dentistry, the treatment paradigm is “minimally invasive dentistry”, where we try to keep things as conservative as possible for the best long-term prognosis. X-rays are needed for that, as small cavities that are forming in between teeth are not visible with a clinical exam. Only when the cavity gets larger and larger will there be clinical changes in appearance.<br /><div>&nbsp;</div>For some procedures such as root canals and dental implants, x-rays are an absolute necessity to provide proper care.<br /><div>&nbsp;</div>Many people worry about radiation, but the radiation is minimal for dental x-rays and decades of use have shown that they are safe.<br /><div>&nbsp;</div>2) If I brush my teeth twice a day and floss regularly, I do not need to come see a dentist.<br /><div>&nbsp;</div>Even though most dental problems are preventable with good oral hygiene, some people are at higher risk of developing problems in their mouth. This may be a result of individual genetic makeup, medications being taken, and/or dietary habits.<br /><div>&nbsp;</div>As such, it is recommended for people to visit their dental professional for a comprehensive examination, which includes evaluation of the jaw joints, an oral cancer screening, a soft tissue exam, along with an exam of our bite, gum health, and any other conditions.<br />div>&nbsp;</div>Depending on what is discovered, more or less frequent checkup intervals will be recommended as opposed to the often mentioned 6 month checkups.<br /><div>&nbsp;</div> 3) There is no point in fixing cavities on baby teeth, as the baby teeth will fall out anyway.<br /><div>&nbsp;</div>Baby teeth do indeed get replaced as the adult teeth develop and erupt. But if cavities are left unchecked on baby teeth, they can grow very large very fast. This can cause pain for the child, which would disrupt learning and sleep schedules.<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div> If left untreated, an infection could form by the gum area, which could result in a facial swelling. These infectious bacteria can also affect the developing permanent tooth right below. <br /><div>&nbsp;</div> At worst, there could be a systemic infection and the child will develop fever and needs hospitalization.<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div> If the baby tooth is pulled prematurely instead of restored and a gap is left, then there will be a reduction of space in the jaw for the permanent teeth to come out. This will result in crowding and teeth that erupt in a non-ideal manner. <br /> <div>&nbsp;</div> As such, children should be visiting their dentist regularly to ensure that problems do not become overly complex. <br /> <div>&nbsp;</div> 4) Fluoride is harmful to my body, and I refuse to have anything to do with fluoride. <br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>Fluoride in toothpaste has been shown throughout the previous decades of scientific research to have a drastic effect on reducing the amount of cavities in our mouth compared to non-fluoridated toothpaste. <br /> <div>&nbsp;</div> For children, because of their smaller size and weight, and they use less toothpaste, correspondingly.<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div> Because toothpaste is not normally ingested during brushing, there is minimal risk of fluoride toxicity. The topical effect it has through 3 to 4 minutes of daily brushing is extremely beneficial in remineralizing our teeth from plaque. <br /> <div>&nbsp;</div> 5) If I do not have any pain, then that means there are no problems with my teeth and gums. <br /> <div>&nbsp;</div> Dental problems are not symptomatic when they begin, similar to other illnesses such as high blood pressure and diabetes.<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div> Whether it is the initial stages of gum disease or the beginning of tooth decay, none of these cause pain at the onset. If left undetected and untreated, they will progress to a point where symptoms happen. <br /> <div>&nbsp;</div> For gum disease, this includes receding and swollen gums, bigger black triangles, and eventually loose teeth and possibly an infection.<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div> Tooth decay also never stops growing, but the rate at which it grows is unpredictable. Once the decay gets very large and closer to the nerve of the tooth, a toothache will likely occur. Root canal treatment may be needed, and oftentimes a crown will be required after root canal treatment.<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div> With medical conditions such as high blood pressure and diabetes, we all know that the earlier they are detected and managed, the more predictable and successful the outcome is. The same is true for conditions in our mouth. <br /> <div>&nbsp;</div> 6) If my gums bleed when I brush, I should avoid brushing them to avoid irritating them. <br /> <div>&nbsp;</div> Bleeding gums are a sign of active inflammation in our gums, commonly known as gingivitis (-itis means inflammation of any body part, gingi- is the short form of gingiva, the scientific word for gums). The primary cause of inflammation is due to bacterial plaque, but for some people they may be a secondary result of hormonal changes (such as in pregnant women or teenagers through puberty), or as a side effect of some medications.<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div> If the bacterial plaque is removed via thorough brushing and flossing, the inflammation in our gums will decrease and the bleeding will minimize or stop, since the area is now clean.<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div> So, contrary to what you may believe, bleeding gums means we should brush and floss them more diligently, but properly. Light pressure with soft or extra soft toothbrushes is all that is required. Flossing should also be done correctly to prevent gouging our gums.<br /> These misconceptions may have popped up amongst conversation with your friends and family, and this post may have helped you to clarify any questions or doubts.   `

        <br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
        Night-Guard:
        <br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
        The primary treatment modality for bruxism is a night-guard, (known as an occlusal splint).
        <br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
        Night-guards are made from a soft or hard acrylic. The use of a night-guard allows the tooth to grind against something softer than the opposing tooth, which ultimately decrease muscular, joint pain and discomfort.
        <br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
        Instead of grinding away the own tooth structure, the night-guard acrylic is sacrificed. The average lifetime of a night-guard is typically 2-3 years before it is worn out.
        <br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
        Two general types of night-guards available:
        <br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
        1) An over-the-counter nightguard that is available for under $100 
        <img src=${require("../assets/blog/118b5d_51d7149ab0e34e63aeb43dff1920eaa7_mv2.webp")} />
        <br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
        All copyrights belong to original source
        <br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
        2) A custom-fitted night-guard made by a dental professional.
        <br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
        <img src=${require("../assets/blog/118b5d_fa4dc58008a646cbbcba657920c1c5ab_mv2_d_2605_2357_s_2.webp")} />
        <br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
        A custom fit night-guard for a patient at MC<sup>2</sup> Dental.
        <br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
        What kind of night-guard should I choose?
        <br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
For people with average jaw and tooth size, shapes, and alignment, an over-the-counter night-guard is a good and economical option.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
However, for others, they may not fit well and sacrifice comfort for convenience.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
A custom-made night-guard costs more but the fit and comfort will be significantly better than an over-the-counter one. The material is also more durable and better suited for longterm use.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
In the end, a  custom-made night-guard might be the better choice.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
Small Changes to Make In Daily Routine: – Stress reduction exercises such as deep breathing and relaxing the mind are also helpful.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
– Reduce your caffeine, tobacco and alcohol intake, as high amounts of these compounds are associated with bruxing. – Ensure you have good quality sleep. Keep your electronics away or on sleep mode to avoid disruptions in the middle of the night.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
– If you have risk factors for sleep apnea such as a large neck, being overweight, and there’s snoring or tooth grinding at night, it’s likely a sleep study is warranted to diagnose the cause of bruxing.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
Still experiencing joint and muscle pain?
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
If you experience joint and muscle pain as a result of bruxing, a mild dose of muscle relaxant can help relieve the discomfort. Be sure to read and follow the dosage instruction printed on the over-the-counter medication. When in doubt or if the pain persists, consult your dentist.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
Another option is to use a cold compress on the affected temporomandibular (jaw) joints. Apply the cold compress for 5 minutes, followed by 10 minutes off. Repeat for an hour.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
Our dental team at MC2 Dental evaluates every patient for signs of tooth grinding.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
Some indications of bruxing may include: wear patterns on teeth, patient’s reported joint or muscle discomfort, or broken restorations.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
Please inform us if you have any of the aforementioned symptoms, as sometimes the symptoms precede the signs by a large margin.

        <br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
Have you ever woken up with sore jaws? Ever chip your tooth without having remember on biting on anything out of the ordinary? Perhaps you are undergoing nighttime bruxism, the formal term of tooth grinding.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
This is a parafunctional habit, which means that we are using our mouths for something other than drinking, eating, or talking.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
Who does it, and why?
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
Estimates of tooth grinding suggest that it happens in approximately 8% of the population, but there have been reports of it being as high as 30% of the population.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
With something this prevalent, the next logical step is to figure out what the causes of teeth grinding are.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
Initially, it was thought that misaligned teeth and uneven bites were the primary cause of tooth grinding, and our jaws want to grind our teeth until we establish a stable bite between our upper and lower teeth. This has mostly been disproven as even people with ideal and stable bites may grind their teeth.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
In the 1990’s, stress was thought to be the major factor of tooth grinding. With the modern busy lives that people have, stress is a contributing factor to many chronic illnesses, including insomnia, high blood pressure, anxiety, and depression.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
Along with stress, increased caffeine, tobacco, and alcohol usage are associated with grinding.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
<img  src=${require("../assets/blog/giphy-4.gif")}/>
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
If only we could all sleep as soundly and quickly as her!
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
In the 2000’s, there has been research into other factors related to bruxism which led to sleep quality studies. There has been growing evidence that bruxism is a cofounding factor and possibly a precursor to sleep apnea. This theory stems from the fact that people with sleep apnea have a partially or fully blocked airway. When people have this, they grind their teeth and shift their jaws to attempt opening the airway.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
Unfortunately, nothing is conclusive as of yet, but the reason for bruxism is likely multifactorial: a combination of all the reasons mentioned previously and possibly even more that have not yet been determined.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
What does it affect?
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
Bruxism can cause a multitude of problems, starting with its direct effect on our mouths and jaws.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
After a few hours of nighttime grinding, people often report they wake up with sore jaws, sore joints, sore muscles, and a mild headache.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
Over a longer period of time, our teeth also get worn away through a process called dental attrition. This results in our tooth structure being ground down, accelerating the destruction of any dental restorative work such as fillings, crowns, and bridges.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
<img src=${require("../assets/blog/118b5d_b2e0dbb23a1b48e7a446b0c51c424342_mv2.webp")} />
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
Untreated tooth grinding over many years causing upper molar enamel to be completely chipped off.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
In more severe cases , there may be facial appearance changes, a collapsed bite, and possible fracture of teeth.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
<img src=${require("../assets/blog/118b5d_cd07f7c76efb4cf9bdf66982e864bea5_mv2.webp")} />
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
Red circle shows cracked cusp (tip) of upper left premolar which was freely movable and causing the patient a lot of pain. Unfortunately the tooth needed to be extracted. Orange circle shows exposed dentin (more yellow in colour) as enamel has worn away.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
For people who have lost teeth and replaced them with dental implants, bruxing is also implicated in reduced implant success.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
As mentioned, bruxism can be co-related to sleep apnea. In some situations, early signs of bruxism warrant a sleep study, especially if the individual has other risk factors for sleep apnea, such as snoring at night, having a large neck, and being overweight.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
Next up, how do we prevent or treat bruxism?

        <br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
        When it comes to dental caries, commonly known as cavities, the usual treatment involves a direct restoration, aka a filling. For those unfamiliar, dental caries is treated by accessing the decayed portion of the tooth and excavating all the decay out with hand and rotary instruments. Once the tooth is “prepared”, the filling material is ready to be placed.
        <br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
This post will describe the different materials used for direct restorations and the pros and cons of each. The indications of each will also be evaluated.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
Indirect restorations, such as crowns and bridges, generally use different materials as they are fabricated in a dental laboratory. These will be discussed in a later blog post.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
1) Amalgam
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
Dental amalgam, also known as silver fillings, have been used very successfully since the early 1900’s.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
The composition of amalgam includes silver, tin, copper, mercury, and small amounts of other metals such as zinc.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
Many people are concerned with the toxicity of mercury present in dental amalgam, but after many decades of successful usage and even more research, the science says they are extremely safe for dental use.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
Advantages of amalgam include
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
i) Faster placement.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
This saves the patient time as amalgams can be placed in bulk much quicker than composite resins.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
ii) High compressive strength.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
They do not break easily when chewing on them.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
iii) Moisture tolerance.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
Amalgam restorations do not require the working area to be completely dry, so amalgams can successfully be placed even in difficult to isolate areas such as the teeth in the very back of the mouth or patients who gag if attempting to install a rubber dam
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
Disadvantages include –
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
i) Poor esthetics.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
Amalgam is a metal alloy and is silver coloured, so in areas of esthetic concern it should not be used. It can also stain the tooth with a dark-grey shade over time.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
<img src=${require("../assets/blog/118b5d_239a83860bca4970843fa885dfbc2706_mv2.webp")} />
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
ii) Minimal thickness required of 1.5mm.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
This is because of its poor tensile and shear strength. For very small cavities, the dentist will have to drill deeper than required to provide necessary bulk for the amalgam.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
iii) Galvanic shock.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
When people with amalgam restorations eat with metal utensils, there is sometimes an electric jolt like a static electricity shock that occurs because of two different types of metals contacting each other.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
iv) Environmental concerns.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
Countries in Europe have started banning and phasing out dental amalgam entirely, not because of human safety, but because of environmental concerns. Amalgam scraps require special disposal methods, and when not properly treated, some of the heavy metals ends up back in the environment that harms our planet.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
We use Solmetex’s HG5© amalgam separator to ensure that we are playing our part in keeping our planet clean and sustainable.

<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
2) Composite Resin
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
Composite resins are what are commonly known as white or tooth-coloured fillings. These are made of a resin matrix with filler particles dispersed throughout for strength.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
When dental composites were first introduced in the 1960’s, they were worse than amalgam in almost all aspects. They were weak, they would not adhere to teeth properly, and they were not colour stable either.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
However, since the late 1990’s, the technology has drastically improved.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>

<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
Below are some of the advantages of composite resins
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
i) High strength.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
Composites are now close to matching amalgam in terms of strength. They also do not require a minimum thickness, so for very small cavities there is no need to remove more tooth structure than necessary.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
ii) Bonded to teeth.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
With current generations of bonding agents, the bond to tooth structure is now very good to excellent. Bonding to a tooth allows a better seal between restorative material and tooth.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
iii) Excellent esthetics.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
Composites now match the colours of most teeth extremely well. They also no longer suffer from discolouration over time.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
Disadvantages of composites include –
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
i) Needing a dry working field.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
Proper isolation, either with a rubber dam, a mouth prop such as Isolite©, or various types of cotton rolls, is crucial to ensure success with composites. For cavities that extend into the gum which may result in uncontrollable bleeding or fluids, composite is also not the best choice, as we cannot get a proper bond.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
ii) More time-consuming.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
Composites also take longer to place compared to amalgams, as they require a separate bonding step and many composites cannot be placed in bulk. This results in patients with multiple cavities requiring more visits.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
iii) Higher cost.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
Composite resins also cost more to the patient than dental amalgam because of more steps needed and more supplies needed for the dentist.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
Please visit our Gallery on our website for some sample cases of composite resin restorations.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
3) Glass Ionomer
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
Another category of materials are glass ionomers (GIs). These restorative materials are also tooth coloured, but they are not as esthetic as composite resins because of compositional differences. Few dentists would use this as the material of choice for most patients, but there are some strong indications for using GIs in specific cases.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
The greatest advantages of GIs is that they are
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
i) Fluoride-releasing.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
This enables them to reduce the risk of recurrent decay around the restoration. For patients that are at high risk of decay, this fluoride release is extremely beneficial.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
ii) Moisture tolerant.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
In cases where tooth isolation cannot be achieved in an ideal manner, glass ionomer is a fantastic alternative to composite resins.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
Disadvantages of GIs:
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
i) Imperfect esthetics.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
Glass ionomers tend to have one flat colour, so it is hard for them to look invisible compared to the surrounding tooth.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
ii) Strength not as high.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
Historically, GIs are not as strong as composite resins, so until recently, they have not been used to restore the biting surfaces of posterior teeth.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
With recent advances, there are now hybrid GIs that combine the strength and esthetics of composite resins with the advantages of GIs called resin-modified glass ionomers (RMGIs) which allows a wider variety of applications.

<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>

<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
4) Pulpal Protector or Liner
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
For deep caries that is encroaching the pulp, otherwise known as the nerve of the tooth, irritants such as mechanical and thermal trauma can cause inflammation in the pulp. This can result in sensitivity after a filling was placed, or in the worst case scenario, for the tooth to need a root canal.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
To minimize the chances of this happening, a pulpal protector or liner is placed in areas of close proximity to the nerve. This is usually a calcium hydroxide-based material or a resin-modified glass ionomer. These materials are soothing to the pulp, and help prevent it from inflammation. Then, the restorative material of choice is placed over the liner.      
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>

<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>

<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
For most cases, the tooth will feel as good as new. In some teeth, there may be sensitivity over the next few days, then subsequently subside. In cases where the sensitivity worsens into pain, the tooth may need a root canal despite our best efforts.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
Here at MC<sup>2</sup> Dental, we only restore teeth with composite resin and resin-modified glass ionomers. Although amalgam is a fantastic material with many applications, I believe that its detrimental effect on the environment is something that shys me away from it. Most patients, including myself, also prefer tooth coloured restorations, and that is another reason why we do not use amalgam in our practice anymore.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>

        I don’t remember being this excited for a new school year myself.
        <br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
One thing to keep in both the back and forefront of our minds are the food selections we pick for lunch.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
When I was in Boston doing volunteer dental care for the underserved and underrepresented communities, there were many children who were drinking juices excessively, had candies and chocolates with potato chips for lunch, and who, after school would go to a nearby convenience store to buy more soda and candy.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
Looking into their mouths, it is shocking and sobering on what poor nutrition does to teeth.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
For some 8 years olds, they already have such large cavities on the first molars (which normally erupt at 6 years of age) that they needed to be pulled. This will result in the other adult teeth coming in at non-ideal positions and could result in poor bite, function, and esthetics.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
When their parents were informed of their dental problems, some were very surprised, as they didn’t know about the relationship of diet and dental disease. These parents were motivated to change and improve their family’s nutritional habits.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
Others didn’t seem concerned, as it is common amongst their friends and family to not have many teeth left by the age of 30. They thought having dentures at a young age is “normal”.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
It was challenging to induce a paradigm shift in their way of thought, but worthwhile.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
On that note, below are a few tips on preparing lunch meals that are both delicious AND healthy, and can help us maintain our natural teeth for a long time.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
1) The Main Course
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
No matter what type of food we have, whether it be sandwiches, rice, noodles, or pasta, we should actively choose less processed foods. These provide longer-lasting energy for our active days, and tend to not contain excessive salts or sugars.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
This includes whole-grain, complex carbohydrates such as multigrain bread, choosing brown rice over white rice, and whole wheat pasta.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
We also know that protein-rich foods are non-cariogenic, meaning that they do not cause cavities. Examples are cheese, tofu, and meats.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
<img src=${require("../assets/blog/36767e47115c4f57a4cf61b077690a9f.webp")} /> 
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
Admittedly, this wouldn’t seem appetizing to me as a child, but now I look at this and my stomach starts churning
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
2) The Drinks
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
There’s a saying in survival training that we cannot survive for more than 3 minutes without air, more than 3 days without water, and more than 3 weeks without food.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
This highlights the importance of hydration for our bodies, which will help us stay focused throughout our school and work days.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
For the majority of people, the drink of choice should always be water. Vancouver has fantastic tasting tap water, and if the thought of drinking tap water is unappealing, there are always filters available for purchase.     
<br /><div>&nbsp;</div>
<img src=${require("../assets/blog/0509f257392744129433294f43c1310c.webp")} />
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
Water: the source of life on Earth
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
Pop and other sugary drinks is not recommended by the American Association of Pediatric Dentistry, as the sugar content in these is very high, and the drinks are also acidic.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
This is reaffirmed by the Canadian Pediatric Society, as they have recently released a statement strongly urging all people under the age of 18 to avoid sports and energy drinks. These beverages contain excessive amounts of sugar, and often caffeine, which is often in too high concentrations for children. Excessive caffeine can cause heart rhythm abnormalities, dangerous blood pressure levels, and even seizures.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
More information be found <a href="http://globalnews.ca/news/3767379/under-18-avoid-sports-drinks-and-energy-drinks-canadian-paediatric-society-warns/" > here.</a>
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
3) The Snacks
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
<img src=${require("../assets/blog/a17a9189b27146a0ab0d69097df986e3.webp")} />
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
A delicious snack for almost any season.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
Options such as granola with unsweetened yogurt, combines a non-cariogenic food source (the yogurt) with a crunchy food like granola. Crunchy foods are great for people who enjoy them, but be wary not to take large, strong bites if your dental professional has advised that your teeth are susceptible to chipping or cracking.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
Yogurt is also a source of probiotics, and these probiotics have numerous positive effects on our body, such as maintaining a good balance of oral flora, and also helping our digestive system run its daily course (pun intended!)
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
I hope readers will have learned a few things from these tidbits of advice. Feel free to contact your dental professional or us at <a href="mailto:joeyyu@mc2dental.ca?subject=" > MC<sup>2</sup> Dental</a> for any questions or comments.

        <br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
        One of the most common questions that I am asked is, “do I really need an x-ray?”
        <br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
Dental x-rays, or dental radiographs, have suffered from a public reputation problem lately, with some recent published articles gaining popularity on the internet claiming that dental x-rays are unsafe and are linked to a multitude of health problems.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
<img src=${require("../assets/blog/giphy-7.gif")} />  
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
1) What are dental x-rays?
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
Dental x-rays, like medical x-rays, require a tubehead with an energy source to create x-rays using an electron stream. X-rays are high-energy electromagnetic particles in the same spectrum as visible light as radio waves that will pass through our tissues and project to a film to provide an image that our naked eyes cannot see.     
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
<img src=${require("../assets/blog/giphy-8.gif")} />
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
Traditionally, dental x-rays were taken on film, not unlike films used in the 80’s and 90’s for cameras.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
Nowadays, many dental offices, including ours at <a href="/mc2dental_new" >MC<sup>2</sup> Dental,</a> have switched to digital x-rays, which can be viewed almost immediately, as opposed to processing x-ray films. Digital x-rays also greatly decrease radiation exposure (~80-90% less radiation) to both the patient and our staff, and have increased clarity and resolution to help see things clearer.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
2) Why do we need dental x-rays?
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
Doing a clinical examination without x-rays may result in dental problems being missed. This includes cavities in between teeth (interproximal cavity), areas of isolated bone loss due to gum disease, or even pathology such as tumours or cancer.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
When gum disease is severe, or when a cavity is large, it can be seen without an x-ray. But do we want our problems to progress to near the point of no return when it could have been diagnosed and treated earlier? Most likely not.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
<img src=${require("../assets/blog/giphy-9.gif")} />
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
3) When do we need dental x-rays?
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
At <a href="/mc2dental_new" >MC<sup>2</sup> Dental</a>, especially for new patients, we would like to have a full set of x-rays as a starting point for diagnosis. If you have had x-rays taken at another dental office within the last 2 to 3 years, then they can be forwarded to our office and we may not need to capture new images.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
For returning patients, we follow the <a href="http://www.ada.org/~/media/ADA/Member%20Center/FIles/Dental_Radiographic_Examinations_2012.pdf" >American Dental Association’s guidelines</a> on frequency and type of radiographs taken. This takes into account individual risk factors for gum disease and cavities, the patient’s age, and the stage of dental development. Every recommendation we make is based on clinical experience, science, and expertise.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
4) How safe are dental x-rays?
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
Dental x-rays are very safe. To reduce radiation exposure to patients even more, a lead apron is provided so no unnecessary exposure is given to other body parts.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
Even for pregnant women, the benefits of dental x-rays often outweigh the (very small) risks.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
Below is an infographic on the safety of dental x-rays compared to environmental radiation that we acquire in our day-to-day lives.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
<img src=${require("../assets/blog/118b5d_bcc664832728436f873304c2aef455cf_mv2.webp")} />
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
As with anything else, please talk to your dental professional or email me if you have any questions. We all want to provide the best care to our patients, and education goes a long way in doing that.

        This summer, with the BC wildfires and the general increase in temperatures globally, Vancouver has been hit hard with a smokey heat wave.
        <br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
Whether we are at work, on the go, or at home, it is hard to keep cool and not sweat. As we sweat, we are expending our body’s water content. In order to stay hydrated, many people opt for beverages more “flavourful” than water, like sports drinks, coconut water, iced tea, juice and more.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
Many of these beverages contain sugar or acid contents, with the worst offenders being energy drinks and pop. These drinks are detrimental to our teeth by increasing the risk of cavities dramatically.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
Even seemingly-healthy choices such as juice often contain a very concentrated amount of sugar.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
While a choice like coconut water may seem like a healthy choice with natural minerals to help balance the body, some coconut water have unnecessary added sugar. The next time you are shopping for coconut water, read the label and choose unsweetened coconut water.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
If you absolutely must quench your thirst with a sugary drink, please try to have some water with it to dilute the sugar.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
4 tips to stay hydrated while being cavity-conscious:
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
1) Bring a water bottle, and fill it up with water only. Nothing cures thirst better than water.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
2) If you crave a cold beverage, get an insulated water bottle and use it to keep your water cold throughout the day.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
3) Iced black coffee or tea (without added sugar) for those who want caffeine.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
4) Coconut water without the added sugar makes a good electrolyte replacement.
<br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
Note that coffee and dark teas can stain teeth over time, and removing these stains often require a professional dental cleaning.

        When <a href="/mc2dental_new/#ourTeam" >Dr. Jui-Feng Ray Yu</a> and I were invited to a dental community outreach opportunity by Master Michael Chiao, who hosts Chiao’s Tai-Chi Club at various community centres in Vancouver, we immediately jumped on board to offer a dental panel session.
        <br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
        Topics discussed are 4 common problems encountered in oral health:
        <br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
        – Cavities
        <br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
        – Gum disease
        <br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
        – Oral cancer
        <br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
        – Occlusal (biting) problems
        <br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
        (The above topics will be discussed extensively in later blog posts. Stay tuned!)
        <br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
        With more than 60 members of the community in attendance, the panel session was very interactive and offered educational tips for everyone to take home and apply to their daily, routine dental care.
        <br /> <div>&nbsp;</div>
        Dr. Jui-Feng Ray Yu and I thank the British Columbia Dental Association for providing us with materials to make the presentation a success. As well, thank you to Kensington Community Centre and the Chiao’s Tai-Chi Club for inviting MC2 Dental this outreach opportunity.
