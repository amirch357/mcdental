                After scaling and/or root planing, due to transient irritation of your soft tissues from our instruments and the bacteria removed, you may feel some soreness or discomfort for the next couple of days. The discomfort is well-tolerated by the majority of people, and afterwards you should notice firmer, tighter gums and decreased bleeding when brushing and flossing.
